# Problem
You are given an unweighted, undirected tree. Write a program to find a vertex set of minimum size in this tree such that each edge has as least one of its end-points in that set.

### Input
The first line of the input file contains one integer _N_ --- number of nodes in the tree (0 < _N_ <= 100000). Next _N_\-1 lines contain _N_\-1 edges of that tree --- Each line contains a pair (_u_, _v_) means there is an edge between node _u_ and node _v_ (1 <= _u_,_v_ <= _N_).

### Output
Print number of nodes in the satisfied vertex set on one line.

### Example 1
>Input:<br/>
3<br/>
1 2<br/>
1 3<br/>

>Output:<br/>
1<br/>

>Explanation<br/>
The set can be {1}

### Example 2
>Input:<br/>
3<br/>
1 2<br/>
2 3<br/>

>Output:<br/>
1<br/>

>Explanation<br/>
The set can be {2}
