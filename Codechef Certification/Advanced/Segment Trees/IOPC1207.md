We need three segment trees. One for each axis x, y and z. The node in the segment tree will store the number of coordinates having red colour.

We initially start with value 0(green) for all coordinates and then perform lazy updates(flips) for the segment of respective(x, y, z) segment tree.

The ones having odd number of flips will have the red colour.

We can count the total number of ODD flips in all dimensions in two possible ways:

1) The plant was flipped in ONE dimension
2) The plant was flipped in ALL THREE dimensions

The exposure to three dimensions is then `(rx*ry*rz)`, while the exposure to one dimension is `(rx*gy*gz) + (ry*gx*gz) + (rz*gx*gy)`.
Hence,

total reds = `(rx*ry*rz) + (rx*gy*gz) + (ry*gx*gz) + (rz*gx*gy)`
