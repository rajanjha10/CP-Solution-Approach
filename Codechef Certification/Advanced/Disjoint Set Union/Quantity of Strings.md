For a string to be a palindrome, all the characters to the left side of half of the length of the string should be same as the ones on the right side. Formally, s[0] = s[n-1], s[1] = s[n-2], ......

We will use a disjoint set union to find the different connected components that should have the same value. Our answer would be m<sup>e</sup> where e = no. of connected components.

eg: n = 5, k = 4;
indices: 0 1 2 3 4
To make palindrome of size 4 starting at index 0, the characters at index 0 and 3 should be equal. Similarly, the characters at index 1 and 2 should be equal.

To make palindrome of size 4 starting at index 1, the characters at index 1 and 4 should be equal. Similarly, the characters at index 2 and 3 should be equal.

Equal characters indices: (0 3), (1 2), (1, 4), (2, 3).

We perform union on these indices and get one connected component. Inside a component all the indices will have the same value. For each value we have m possibilities, hence our answer is m<sup>no. of connected components</sup>.
